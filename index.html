                    <h1>Rethinking the idea of the guitar pick.</h1>
                    <p>Guitar picks are the bridge between you and your
                        instrument. Like most of us, you surely spent a lot of
                        time choosing your guitar, your favourite pedals, amps,
                        and even the strings or the jack cable. But, what about
                        your pick? You probably didn't think much about it and
                        you are using the same pick you used early in your
                        career. The sound of an instrument depends highly on the
                        kind of pick you are using.</p>
